# Salve test

I have kept this solution as simple as I could as per the brief.

## Backend

For the back end I have used a simple node.js and express set up which reads the csv files and exposes via 2 endpoints. One for clinics and one for patients.

To run the back end, in the server directory, run:

### `yarn start`

## Front end

The front end is a cra react app with some custom hooks for managing data fetching from the backend.

I used styled-components for the styling
To run the front end, in the app directory, run:

### `yarn start`

To run tests, in the app directory, run:

### `yarn start`

## Backend

## If I were to continue spending time on this task, I would:

-test
-test
-test
